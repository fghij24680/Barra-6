# Barra-6

This is a prototype of Barra 6 (CNE6) model based on the multi-factor model and the report by Bohai Securities,《Barra风险模型（CNE6）之纯因子构建与因子合成》(_Barra risk model (CNE6) of pure factor construction and factor synthesis_).

In this model, factors are classified as size, vol, liquidity, value, quality, momentum, growth and divident yield. Besides, we added the industry factors to this model.
